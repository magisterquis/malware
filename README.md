A collection of tools I've hacked together for CTFs and such

Please don't use these for illegal purposes.  Also, encryption and
authentication isn't guaranteed (and likely isn't present at all), so don't use
these for anything outside of CTFs and maybe really light pentesting.

That's subject to change, though.
